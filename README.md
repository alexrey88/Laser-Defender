# Laser Defender 2D

## Overview

This 2D laser defender game was developed using Unity version 2021.3.28f1, following the Udemy course [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-unity-developer-2d/). However, the codebase was then refactored to improve maintainability (notable changes include breaking down the code into smaller functions and adding null reference verifications).

## Features

The following features were added outside of the course, showcasing additional creative development beyond the original tutorial content:

- **Health Boosters:** Randomly generated health boosters appear during the game to increase the player's health, with lower and higher boosters having varying probabilities of occurrence.

- **Random Enemy Prefabs:** Each wave now features randomly selected enemy prefabs, adding diversity and unpredictability to the enemy encounters.

- **Info Panel on Main Menu:** An informative panel has been added to the main menu screen, incorporating sprite assets into the TextMeshPro component for a visually appealing presentation.

- **Dynamic Enemy Firing Rate:** As the game progresses, enemy firing rate increases, adding a layer of challenge and intensity to the gameplay.
